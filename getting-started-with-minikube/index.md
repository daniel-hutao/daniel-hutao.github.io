# Getting Started with minikube


What’s up guys, this is Daniel! Yeah, this English blog is WRITTEN by me, not TRANSLATED by me! It’s my first English blog in my whole life. If you are a Chinese reader, maybe you’ve ever seen my Chinese blogs before. Right, I wrote a lot of blogs, but only in Chinese. Believe it or not, English isn’t my strong suit. But I want to have a try today and I’ll do my best. Let’s get started.

## What We Will Talk about Today

If you ask me how to create a local Kubernetes cluster, I'll tell you [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io), [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), and [Kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/) are all good choices. If you ask me which tool is the most recommended for beginners, my answer must be `minikube` or `Kind`. `minikube` is more powerful than `Kind`, and `Kind` is easier than `minikube`.

In my previous article, I walked you guys through "How to Create a Local Kubernetes Cluster from the Ground Up" with `Kind`. If you are interested, here's a quick link for you:

- [Creating a Local Kubernetes Cluster from the Ground Up](/blog/local-k8s-with-kind#install-docker)

You might ask why that article is written by [Tiexin Guo](https://github.com/IronCore864), not me. Of course! As I said in the beginning, this blog you are reading now is my first English blog. So, technically, the one above isn’t “my” article, but I did write the Chinese version of it:

- [从零开始快速搭建本地 Kubernetes 测试环节](https://www.devstream.io/zh/blog/local-k8s-with-kind)

Both `minikube` and `Kind` are the most well-known and popular choices to run a Kubernetes environment on a local computer. Since I've shown you how to use `Kind`, I might as well introduce `minikube` to youadorable today.

## Quick Start with `minikube`

`minikube` is a command-line tool like `Kind` that you can use to create and configure Kubernetes clusters locally on your computer. 

### How to Install `minikube`

If your computer is the same as mine, Mac with m1 chip, you can install the latest `minikube` stable release in 2 steps:

```sh
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-darwin-arm64
sudo install minikube-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

If you are using `Homebrew`, just one command:

```sh
brew install minikube
```

If your computer is of other platforms or architectures, see the “Installation” section in [minikube start](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) for more details.

### `minikube start`

Like the section title we used here, to start using minikube, run `minikube start`:

```sh
$ minikube start
😄  minikube v1.25.2 on Darwin 12.2.1 (arm64)
👎  Unable to pick a default driver. Here is what was considered, in preference order:
    ▪ docker: Not healthy: "docker version --format {{.Server.Os}}-{{.Server.Version}}" exit status 1: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
    ▪ docker: Suggestion: Start the Docker service <https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/>
💡  Alternatively you could install one of these drivers:
    ▪ hyperkit: Not installed: exec: "hyperkit": executable file not found in $PATH
    ▪ parallels: Not installed: exec: "prlctl": executable file not found in $PATH
    ▪ vmware: Not installed: exec: "docker-machine-driver-vmware": executable file not found in $PATH
    ▪ virtualbox: Not installed: unable to find VBoxManage in $PATH
    ▪ podman: Not installed: exec: "podman": executable file not found in $PATH

❌  Exiting due to DRV_DOCKER_NOT_RUNNING: Found docker, but the docker service isn't running. Try restarting the docker service.
```

Ok, it doesn’t matter; we need to install Docker. In my previous article [How to Create a Local Kubernetes Cluster from the Ground Up](/blog/local-k8s-with-kind#install-docker), I introduced how to "Install Docker".

After the Docker is installed, what we'll need in total?

- A not too bad computer;
- Internet connections;
- Container or virtual machine hypervisor, such as: Docker, Hyper-V, KVM, VirtualBox, or VMware Workstation ...

Let's try to run `minikube start` again. This command is time-consuming the first time you use it, especially if the network speed is low. Feel free to have a cup of coffee then come back to see the result.

2000 years later...

Well Done! 0 error, 0 warning! The logs are beautiful!

### Access Your Shiny Kubernetes Cluster

Do you have `kubectl` installed? If yes, you can now use it to access your shiny Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
$ kubectl get pod -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
kube-system   coredns-64897985d-hdmqd            1/1     Running   0               3m10s
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running   0               3m24s
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   0               3m25s
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   0               3m25s
kube-system   kube-proxy-nkzmn                   1/1     Running   0               3m10s
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   0               3m23s
kube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   1 (2m40s ago)   3m22s
```

Alternatively, `minikube` can download the appropriate version of `kubectl` with the command `minikube kubectl`:

```sh
minikube kubectl -- get pod -A
    > kubectl.sha256: 64 B / 64 B [--------------------------] 100.00% ? p/s 0s
    > kubectl: 52.82 MiB / 52.82 MiB [--------------] 100.00% 6.04 MiB p/s 8.9s
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
kube-system   coredns-64897985d-hdmqd            1/1     Running   0              4m32s
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running   0              4m46s
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   0              4m47s
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   0              4m47s
kube-system   kube-proxy-nkzmn                   1/1     Running   0              4m32s
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   0              4m45s
kube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   1 (4m2s ago)   4m44s
```

Cooooool!

Are you thinking this command is too complicated? Use the config below and you'll be happy:

```sh
alias kubectl="minikube kubectl --"
```

I'm used to command-line to access the Kubernetes cluster. Yes, I never use the Kubernetes Dashboard. But if you like to have some insight into your cluster state with a Dashboard, `minikube` bundles it for you:

```sh
$ minikube dashboard
🔌  Enabling dashboard ...
    ▪ Using image kubernetesui/dashboard:v2.3.1
    ▪ Using image kubernetesui/metrics-scraper:v1.0.7
🤔  Verifying dashboard health ...
🚀  Launching proxy ...
🤔  Verifying proxy health ...
🎉  Opening http://127.0.0.1:51801/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/ in your default browser...
```

At this time, your browser will automatically open a new tab, and the Dashboard will soon show up:

![Kubernetes Dashboard](./dashboard.png)

### Deploy an Application in Your Shiny Kubernetes Cluster

Let’s create a sample deployment with the image `preslavmihaylov/kubehelloworld:latest` and expose it on port 3000.

The [minikube start](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) told us to use the `k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4` to launch the `hello-minikube` application, but it'll fail on a Mac with m1 chip. See [this issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/11107) for more details. 

```sh
$ kubectl create deployment sample-deploy --image=preslavmihaylov/kubehelloworld:latest
deployment.apps/sample-deploy created
$ kubectl expose deployment sample-deploy --type=NodePort --port=3000
service/sample-deploy exposed
$ kubectl get pod
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sample-deploy-795887588d-flkgb   1/1     Running   0          50s
$ kubectl get svc
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP          66m
sample-deploy   NodePort    10.107.59.38   <none>        3000:32631/TCP   43s
```

Then we can use `kubectl` to forward the port:

```sh
$ kubectl port-forward service/sample-deploy 3000:3000
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3000 -> 3000
Forwarding from [::1]:3000 -> 3000
```

Open the browser, visit `localhost:3000`, and "Hello World!" will soon show up.

Another way to access this service is to use the `minikube service sample-deploy` command and minikube will launch a browser page for you with the right `url:port` address.

And we can use the command `minikube tunnel` to use the `LoadBalancer` type Service. Here is an example:

```sh
$ kubectl delete service sample-deploy
service "sample-deploy" deleted
$ kubectl expose deployment sample-deploy --type=LoadBalancer --port=3000
service/sample-deploy exposed
```

In another terminal window, start the tunnel to create a routable IP with the command `minikube tunnel`:

```sh
$ minikube tunnel
✅  Tunnel successfully started

📌  NOTE: Please do not close this terminal as this process must stay alive for the tunnel to be accessible ...

🏃  Starting tunnel for service sample-deploy.
```

Now you can use the `EXTERNAL-IP` to access the Service:

```sh
$ kubectl get svc
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          86m
sample-deploy   LoadBalancer   10.96.205.167   127.0.0.1     3000:31945/TCP   28s
$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000
Hello World!
```

## How to Manage the Cluster

I'll show you some commands here:

- `minikube pause` # Pause Kubernetes cluster without impacting any deployed resources.
- `minikube unpause` # Unpause the Paused Kubernetes cluster.
- `minikube stop` # Remember the `minikube start`? Need I say more?
- `minikube config set memory 20480` # Change the default memory limit (requires a restart).
- `minikube addons list` # Browse the easily installed Kubernetes addons catalog.
- `minikube start -p aged --kubernetes-version=v1.16.1` # Create a second cluster running an older Kubernetes version.
- `minikube delete --all` # Yeah, delete all, delete anything, delete all clusters.

That's all?

No! But if you want to know them all, I'll show you the [command docs here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/commands/).

## How to Push Images into a `minikube` Cluster

There are about 8 ways you can use to push images into a `minikube` cluster. And I'll show you the most useful two ways today.

### Push Images with the `cache` Command

- `minikube cache add [flags] [options]` # Add an image to local cache.

Cache? Yes, the image will be cached by minikube and automatically pushed into all clusters, not like the `Kind` method: `kind load docker-image <IMAGE> [IMAGE...] [flags]`.

Let's see how many sub-commands `cache` has:

```sh
$ minikube cache -h
Add, delete, or push a local image into minikube

Available Commands:
  add         Add an image to local cache.
  delete      Delete an image from the local cache.
  list        List all available images from the local cache.
  reload      reload cached images.
```

Easy, isn't it?

The only sub-command we need to talk about might be `reload`. If your image changed after you had cached it, you need to execute `minikube cache reload [flags] [options]`

E.g.:

- `minikube cache add alpine:latest` # Cache alpine:latest for all clusters.
- `minikube cache reload alpine:latest` # Reload alpine:latest if it's changed.
- `minikube cache list` # Display what images we have added to the cache.
- `minikube cache delete alpine:latest` # Just delete alpine:latest

### Pushing Directly to the In-Cluster Docker Daemon

If the image we want to use inside the `minikube` cluster is built locally instead of pulled from a registry, we can reuse the Docker daemon inside the `minikube` cluster. Yeah, we don’t have to build the image on our host machine and `cache` it; we can just build inside the same docker daemon inside the `minikube` cluster.

```sh
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                                                                                                                  NAMES

$ eval $(minikube docker-env)
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS     NAMES

...
```

What happened?

After the command `eval $(minikube docker-env)` is executed, `docker` accesses the docker daemon inside the `minikube` cluster! What's the secret with `minikube docker-env` command? Let's dig into it:

```sh
$ minikube docker-env
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://127.0.0.1:50982"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/danielhu/.minikube/certs"
export MINIKUBE_ACTIVE_DOCKERD="minikube"

# To point your shell to minikube's docker-daemon, run:
# eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
```

I don't think I need to explain more about what happened. And we can `build` against the Docker inside `minikube` now. Just execute a command like `docker build -t my-image:latest .`, `my-image:latest` is instantly accessible to the Kubernetes cluster. 

## How to …

Oops, there are many how-tos we could talk about, but I believe that you can start using `minikube` now. Maybe I'll talk about more how-tos next time. If you want to dive into `minikube` now, go ahead and study the [official documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).

## Summary

Cool, I finished writing this blog, It's like opening Pandora's box; I love this feeling. Of course, I know this blog is at the primary-school-student level, but I believe I can do better and better.
